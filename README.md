# Hey there!

This repository consists of my solutions for all the exercises that can be found on Mark Newman's book about computational physics. To do so, I used my own scientific library, the swift ScienceKit, that I developed on the fly depending on what I needed to get to the solution. 

My first goal with this project was to learn more about the field of computational science. But it quickly turned out that it's also a good opportunity to showcase the capabilities of the swift programming language in scientific applications. I found the language to be simple and elegant, so I tried to make a scientific tool that reflects this characteristics.

## How to run those programs.

If you want to run any of these programs by yourself, the easiest course of action is probably to download a copy of the ScienceKit template repository then to copy the code into the main.swift file. All the dependencies are already set so hitting swift run in a terminal inside the template project will suffice. If the exercise requires an external file, just copy it next to main.swift.
