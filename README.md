# Hey there!

This repository contains my solutions to all the exercises from Mark Newman's Computational Physics. To tackle them, I built and used my own scientific library in Swift, ScienceKit, which I developed progressively as new needs arose while working through the problems.

The project began as a way to deepen my understanding of computational science. However, it soon became clear that it also provided a great opportunity to highlight Swift’s potential in scientific computing. I found Swift to be both simple and elegant, and I aimed to design a scientific toolkit that embodies these qualities.

## How to run these programs.

If you’d like to run any of these programs yourself, the simplest way is to download the ScienceKit template repository and copy the exercise code into the main.swift file. All dependencies are already configured, so running swift run in the template’s directory is enough to get started. If an exercise needs an external file, just place it in the same folder as main.swift.
